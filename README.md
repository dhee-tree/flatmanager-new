# Flatmanager

Flatmanager is an app for students living in shared accommodations to create and manage cleaning and bin disposal rotas.
Flatmanager can be seen as a digital rota, but it also manages job rotation and alerts users when it is their turn to do a job.
Flatmanager would use a verification system where other volunteers (caretakers) would verify that the job has been done by flatmates.

## How it works
1. Flatmates register with the QR code for their flat
2. Two flatmates are appointed as caretakers
3. Flatmanager creates bin disposal and kitchen rota for the flat
4. Flatmanager alerts the first flatmate to take out the bins and also alerts the caretakers that the job has been assigned
5. Flatmate takes out the bins and confirms on the app by clicking <b>DONE</b>
6. Flatmanager pends the approval and alerts the caretakers to verify the job
7. Caretakers are alerted and they verify the job, the first caretaker to confirm the job is done is awarded points
8. Flatmanger approves the job as done.

## More context
Kitchen cleaning can be done every week or every two weeks, depending on the flat and their preferences, in this case, Flatmanager would know when kitchen cleaning is to be done and would assign the job to the flatmates accordingly. However, bins cannot be tracked by Flatmanager, so the caretakers would have the option to create a <i>bin out</i> prompt, and then Flatmanager would act based on who's next on the rota.

## Collecting Data
To analyse and predict if the app would be useful, we would need to collect data by sending out surveys to students living in shared accommodations, the aim is to identify which flats think they had issues with cleaning and bin disposal, which flats think cleaning and bin disposal would be better if it was properly managed.
### Sample Survey
1. From 1 - 5, how would you rate your flat's kitchen cleaning?
2. From 1 - 5, how would you rate your flat's bin disposal?
3. Would you be interested in using an app that creates rota and alerts other flatmates when they are supposed to take bins out?

## Competition Breeds Success
Having caretakers who would actually do their jobs can be challenging as students could see no benefits in partaking in such an important role. Hence, so we would need to find a way to incentivise caretakers to do their jobs, this can be done by having 2 caretakers and rewarding the caretaker with points for every job they verify, the caretaker with the most points wins and gets paid.

## War On Other Flats (WOOF)
Caretakers would compete against other caretakers from other flats, like a leaderboard system, the caretaker with the most points wins and gets a bigger reward.
